; This section sets up the digital IO pins to turn on and off. 
; There are eight digital IO pins total. They are in slots 4
; through 11 (the One-Wire being slot 1). The digital IO
; pins are on ports 5, 4 and 3, and their individual pins on
; the CPU are 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 4.0, 4.1, 3.6 and 3.7. 
;
; Note that pins on the CPU are distinct from pins on the dev
; board. This is an unfortunate coincidence of nomenclature.
; Perhaps we should call the dev board pins "slots" or something,
; but we don't.
;
;

; This first bit initializes all the digital IO pins, first setting
; their direction, then setting their output state to low, in
; this case the off state. You must run dp-init before turning
; any of the digital IO pins on or off.

; The following lines create words that turn the individual
; pins on and off. They are numbered sequentially, with the 
; first digital IO pin (adjacent to the analog pins) labelled 
; "1." The last digital IO pin (next to the MISO/MOSI clock) is
; labelled "8." Note that these labels are arbitrary, and we
; could have used anything else we wanted. Only the stanzas
; inside the brackets should be left unchanged, as they 
; refer to other parts of the code.
;
; Example:
; To turn on digital IO pin 1, you type dp1on after loading
; this code.
;
; To turn the pin off, type dp1off, and the same for the
; other pins.
